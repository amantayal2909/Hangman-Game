Project
Hangman is a word guessing game in which player have to guess a word and tries to guess it by suggesting the letters. 
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words.
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. 
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, then program draws one element of the hangman diagram .
This is a simple Hangman game using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT programming  language. Beginners can use this as a project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic.
 Here, a random word is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.
 When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, 
 all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over. For convenience, we have given 10 chances. 
 For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 10 chances .
